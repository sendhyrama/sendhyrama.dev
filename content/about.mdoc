# I'm Sendhy, a mobile developer based in Indonesia

**Hey there! My name is Muhammad Alfian Sendhy Ramadhinata, known as Sendhy Ramadhinata in short.**

I am a software engineer specialized in mobile development, creating mobile based applications.

Born and raised in&nbsp;[ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Majored in Information Systems at&nbsp;[UPN Veteran Jawa Timur](https://upnjatim.ac.id/)&nbsp;in 2020. Currently, I am focused on completing my undergraduate thesis project while also contributing to the community growth of&nbsp;[SurabayaDev](https://surabayadev.org/) and&nbsp;[GDSC UPNVJT](https://gdsc.community.dev/universitas-pembangunan-nasional-veteran-jawa-timur).

I began my programming journey in backend development, creating an app and internal content management system for my Capstone Project from [Bangkit Academy](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) using Express and NodeJS. Subsequently, I transitioned to mobile development, where I developed a keen interest in the Android and Flutter ecosystems and have continued to develop and experiment with them to the present day.
