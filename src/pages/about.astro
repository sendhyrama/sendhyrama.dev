        Hi there! I am Sendhy Ramadhinata, a 3rd-year Information System student at UPN Veteran Jawa Timur. I'm interested in tech business and all about programming especially in Web Development and Cloud Tech. <br><br>
        Currently, I'm focusing on technologies for Frontend Web Development with JavaScript-based ecosystems, such as Next.js, Chakra UI, and Headless CMS (Contentful, DatoCMS, or the one provided by Netlify).<br><br>
        Learning new technologies is essential for me since, in the future, I think illiteracy will be defined as the inability to read programming languages. <br><br>
        In most of my time, I often explore some useful resources, and taking any courses to rank up my skills. Also working on paid projects if there’s an opportunity.
