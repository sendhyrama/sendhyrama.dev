          Hello! I’m CDi, a web developer with a strong background in law. I
          hold a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University,
          where I focused on national cybercrime law, and a Master of Law Degree
          (LL.M.) in Criminal Sciences, where I delved into European cybercrime
          law.

          My Journey to Web Development
        </h2>
        <p
          class="mt-6 space-y-7 text-base text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200"
        >
          My passion for technology and the digital world has been with me since
          I was young, stemming from my fascination with PCs, strategy games,
          and MMORPGs.
        </p>
        <p
          class="mt-6 space-y-7 text-base text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200"
        >
          This passion led me to explore web development through my role as a
          marketing director for Asociatia Studentilor la Drept, where I
          maintained their WordPress website. My curiosity grew stronger as I
          experimented with WordPress and Shopify, eventually leading me to
          attend a coding boot camp in 2022. It was there that I discovered and
          fell in love with React.
